					<p>Casein is basically a Milk Protein. It is the only known source of Animal Protein that found in milk in abundant quantity. It is the principal protein of any milk. It represent 3.5 - 4.0 % of the whole milk and almost 80.0 % of the total protein found in milk. It present in the milk in the form of colloidal particles known as Casein Micelle combined with Calcium Phosphorous Bond. The isoelectric point of Casein is 4.6. It is derived by acid precipitation of skimmed milk. It is insoluble in water and required alkali medium to dissolve.<br>
					<strong>There are mainly 3 basic types of casein depending on its use.</strong>
